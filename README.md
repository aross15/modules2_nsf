Various files from the NSF-sponsored MODULE(S2) project; see modules2.com or https://modules2dotcom.wordpress.com

The MODULE(S2) project creates curriculum materials that provide undergraduate mathematics instructors with a way to provide opportunities for prospective teachers to develop mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) while they learn content in university algebra, geometry, modeling, and statistics courses. 

The materials are designed to be taught with equity-based teaching practices, including going deep with mathematics and affirming mathematics learnersâ€™ identities for everyone taking the course.

We have also saved .zip files of the datasets and animations at our OSF.io project page, https://osf.io/t56em/ ; we might store more things there as well
